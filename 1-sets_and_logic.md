# 1.1 Sets

Sets are a collection of elements: $A = \{1,2,3,4\}$

Large sets are described with more complex set-builder notation: $$B = \{x|x \text{ is a positive, even integer}\}$$
B is the set of all values of $x$, such that each $x$ is a positive, even integer--which is an infinite set. 

Sets with subsets are denoted: $$C = \{1,2,\{3,4\},\{5,6,\{7\}\},8,9,10\}$$

Cardinality, $|X|$, of a set is the number of elements in the set (subsets are each an element). 

$x \in X$ means the $x$ is an element of the set $X$ ($x \not\in X$ has the opposite meaning).

It can be determined if an arbitrary $x$ is in a set by noting whether $x$ is listed in the set visually, or whether $x$ has the property described by the set-builder notation such as being a positive, even integer--$x$ would be an element of $B$.
